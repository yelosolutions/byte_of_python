## Input and Output
There will be situations where a program has to interact with the user.
For example, I would want to take input from the user and then print some results back. 
I can achieve this using the input() function and print function respectively.

For output, I can also use the various methods of the str (string) class. 
For example, I can use the rjust method to get a string which is right justified to a specified width.See help(str) for more details.

Another common type of input/output is dealing with files. 
The ability to create, read and write files is essential to many programs.
